# Mastery Learning Research Summary

Research compiled to inform deep mastery-focused teaching skill design.

## Bloom's Mastery Learning Model

### Core Principle
Students must achieve a level of mastery (typically 80-90% on assessments) in prerequisite knowledge before advancing. If not achieved, additional support and re-testing occurs until mastery is demonstrated.

### The 2 Sigma Problem
Bloom discovered that one-on-one tutoring using mastery techniques produces results **two standard deviations** better than conventional instruction. This is the gold standard we're aiming for.

### Research Effectiveness
- Average effect size of **0.59** (medium to large)
- Nearly **1.5 grade improvement** in GPA within mastery courses
- Dramatic reduction in F grades (1.5% vs traditional rates)

## Mastery Thresholds

### Recommended Standards
- **Minimum:** 80% (B grade equivalent)
- **Maximum:** 90% (unless task is critical)
- Some systems use progressive thresholds: 0.5, 0.8, 0.95, 0.98

### Five Essential Elements for Implementation
1. Specific, clear, demonstrable learning objectives
2. Clear mastery thresholds for each objective
3. Clear processes for students to demonstrate mastery
4. Clear processes for teachers to assess mastery
5. System to track and display mastery progress

## Bloom's Taxonomy - Depth Levels

### Lower-Order Cognitive Skills (LOCS)
1. **Remember** - Recall facts and basic concepts
2. **Understand** - Explain ideas or concepts
3. **Apply** - Use information in new situations

### Higher-Order Cognitive Skills (HOCS)
4. **Analyze** - Draw connections, break into components
5. **Evaluate** - Justify decisions, make judgments
6. **Create** - Produce new work, design solutions

**Key Insight:** Higher-order skills incorporate lower-order skills. To evaluate, one must first know, understand, apply, and analyze.

### Assessment by Cognitive Level

| Level | Question Types |
|-------|---------------|
| Remember | Define, list, recall, identify |
| Understand | Summarize, explain, paraphrase |
| Apply | Use, demonstrate, solve |
| Analyze | Compare, contrast, distinguish, examine |
| Evaluate | Judge, critique, justify, defend |
| Create | Design, construct, develop, formulate |

## The Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition

### Five Stages of Expertise

| Stage | Characteristics | Assessment Focus |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **Novice** | Follows rules rigidly, no discretionary judgment | Recognition, basic recall |
| **Advanced Beginner** | Applies rules to real situations, context emerging | Application in familiar contexts |
| **Competent** | Considerable experience, can plan and prioritize | Problem-solving, planning |
| **Proficient** | Uses intuition, develops own rules, sees patterns | Analysis, adaptation |
| **Expert** | Intuitive, holistic grasp, performs unconsciously | Creation, innovation, teaching others |

### Key Progression Insight
Expertise is characterized by fluid, unconscious performance that no longer depends on explicit rules. Progression requires **diverse situations, reflection, and deliberate practice**—not just repetition.

## Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)

### Definition
The distance between what a learner can do independently and what they can achieve with support.

**Source:** [Zone of Proximal Development - Simply Psychology](https://www.simplypsychology.org/zone-of-proximal-development.html)

### Scaffolding Principles
1. Model the behavior or strategy
2. Provide hints and prompts ("What's the next step?")
3. Break complex tasks into smaller steps
4. Use visual aids and organizers
5. **Gradually release control** as learner progresses

### The I-Do, We-Do, You-Do Model
1. **I Do** - Teacher demonstrates with full support
2. **We Do** - Teacher and student work together
3. **You Do** - Student works independently

## Deliberate Practice (Ericsson)

### What It Actually Means
Not just accumulating hours—must involve:
- Activities designed specifically to improve performance
- Immediate feedback on results
- Focus on areas of weakness
- Significant mental effort (not comfortable)
- Reflection and adjustment

### Key Distinction
"If you're doing your job, and you're just doing more and more of the same, you're not actually going to get better."

## Socratic Questioning

### Characteristics of Deep Questioning
- **Systematic and disciplined** (not random)
- **Focuses on fundamental concepts**
- Forces examination of underlying beliefs
- Distinguishes between fragmented and structured thinking

**Source:** [Socratic Questions - UConn CETL](https://cetl.uconn.edu/resources/teaching-your-course/leading-effective-discussions/socratic-questions/)

### Six Types of Socratic Questions

1. **Clarification** - "What do you mean by...?"
2. **Probing assumptions** - "What are you assuming here?"
3. **Probing reasons/evidence** - "How do you know that?"
4. **Questioning viewpoints** - "What would someone who disagrees say?"
5. **Probing implications** - "What are the consequences of that?"
6. **Questions about the question** - "Why is this question important?"

### Environment
The goal is **productive discomfort**, not intimidation. Students must understand questioning is formative, not punitive.

## Successive Relearning

### Research Finding
Students must achieve mastery thresholds across **3-4 different study sessions** to enhance long-term retention. This produces large effect sizes for long-term memory.

### Implication for Teaching
Don't consider a topic "mastered" after one successful demonstration. Require verification across multiple sessions or contexts.

## Curriculum Progression Principles

### Undergraduate to Graduate Rigor
- Rigor of undergraduate: **diversity of courses + depth in major**
- Rigor of graduate: **solid foundation + advanced scholarly concepts**
- Content proceeds: **introductory → advanced in logical sequence**

**Source:** [Undergraduate and Graduate Course Level Standards](https://www.ursuline.edu/files/assets/courselevelguidelinesugandgrad.pdf)

### High School → College Transition
The journey represents not just content accumulation but **cognitive development**:
- High school: Following procedures, basic analysis
- Early undergrad: Applying concepts, comparing approaches
- Advanced undergrad: Critical evaluation, independent research
- Graduate: Creating knowledge, defending positions, teaching others

## Synthesis: What This Means for Teaching

### Mastery Requirements
1. **80-90% threshold** on assessments before advancing
2. **Multiple verification attempts** across different sessions
3. **Progress through Bloom's levels** (not just surface recall)
4. **Match Dreyfus stage** to appropriate challenges

### Depth Indicators
- Learner can **explain in their own words**
- Learner can **apply to novel situations**
- Learner can **identify when approach doesn't apply**
- Learner can **critique and evaluate alternatives**
- Learner can **teach the concept to others**

### Signs of Shallow Learning (to avoid)
- Parroting definitions without understanding
- Only answering recognition questions correctly
- Unable to apply to new contexts
- Cannot explain "why" behind procedures
- Confusion when problem is rephrased
