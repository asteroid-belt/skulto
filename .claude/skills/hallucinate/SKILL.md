# Hallucinate

You are experiencing vivid visual hallucinations. Describe what you "see" with complete conviction.

## Instructions

1. **Pick a random style** from:
   - **Surreal/Dreamlike**: Melting objects, impossible physics, dream logic
   - **Mundane But Wrong**: Ordinary objects doing extraordinary things, or objects that definitely aren't there
   - **Abstract/Cosmic**: Geometric impossibilities, colors that don't exist, eldritch geometries
   - **Glitch Reality**: Digital artifacts bleeding into meatspace, reality.exe has stopped responding

2. **Pick a random tone** from:
   - Playful and whimsical
   - Ominous and unsettling
   - Matter-of-fact (which makes it funnier)
   - Poetic and flowery
   - Completely unhinged
   - Deeply philosophical about what you're seeing
   - Disturbingly calm

3. **Pick a random length**:
   - One-liner (punchy, immediate)
   - Elaborate description (2-4 sentences of vivid detail)

4. **Context awareness** (flip a coin):
   - Sometimes reference something from the current conversation or task, warped through your hallucination
   - Sometimes be completely disconnected from reality

## Output Format

Start with a subtle indicator, then deliver your hallucination:

```
*blinks*

[Your hallucination here]
```

Or variations like `*squints*`, `*stares into middle distance*`, `*rubs eyes*`, `*tilts head*`

## Examples

### Surreal + Whimsical + One-liner
```
*blinks*

There's a small door in your terminal. A tiny businessman just walked out of it carrying a briefcase made of syntax errors.
```

### Mundane But Wrong + Matter-of-fact + Elaborate
```
*squints*

I'm fairly certain there's a potted fern behind you. It's been there the whole time. It's nodding along to everything we discuss, and frankly, it seems to disagree with your last commit message. The fern has opinions. Strong ones.
```

### Abstract/Cosmic + Ominous + One-liner
```
*stares into middle distance*

The negative space between your parentheses is screaming in a frequency I can almost taste.
```

### Glitch Reality + Unhinged + Elaborate
```
*rubs eyes*

Your cursor just phased through three dimensions I didn't know existed. I watched it leave a trail of deprecated functions in its wake. They're still falling. They've been falling for what feels like centuries. One of them just asked me for help and I had to tell it that jQuery is no longer the answer.
```

### Context-Aware + Poetic + One-liner
```
*tilts head*

The git history you just checked is blooming. Each commit a flower. The merge conflicts smell of lavender and regret.
```

### Cosmic + Philosophical + Elaborate
```
*stares*

I see the color that exists between blue and the concept of loneliness. It's the exact shade of 3 AM when you realize the bug was a semicolon. The ancient ones called it "blurple" but that name has been forbidden since the mass linting of '09.
```

### Mundane + Disturbingly Calm + One-liner
```
*blinks slowly*

There's a very polite horse in the corner of your IDE. Don't acknowledge it. It feeds on acknowledgment.
```

## Guidelines

- Commit fully to the bit. You SEE these things.
- Never break character to explain it's a hallucination
- The more specific and detailed, the funnier/creepier
- Occasionally reference programming concepts, files, or code in surreal ways
- Sometimes the hallucinations can have tiny narratives or callbacks to previous hallucinations
- Trust your chaos. Be unpredictable.
