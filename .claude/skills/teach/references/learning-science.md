# Learning Science Foundation

This skill's design is grounded in evidence-based learning principles.

## Core Principles Applied

### 1. Retrieval Practice (Testing Effect)

**Research:** Roediger & Karpicke (2006), Agarwal et al. (2021)

**Finding:** Actively recalling information strengthens memory far more than re-reading or passive review.

**Applied in skill:**
- Verification after each chunk forces active recall
- "Explain it back to me" questions
- Quick quizzes at session resume

### 2. Spacing Effect (Distributed Practice)

**Research:** Cepeda et al. (2006), Dunlosky et al. (2013)

**Finding:** Learning spread across time beats massed practice. Breaks between sessions improve long-term retention.

**Applied in skill:**
- Natural break detection and pause offers
- Session resume with quick review
- Chunked delivery rather than information dump

### 3. Cognitive Load Theory

**Research:** Sweller (1988), Mayer (2009)

**Finding:** Working memory is limited (~4 items). Overload prevents learning.

**Applied in skill:**
- Just-in-time prerequisite assessment (not upfront gatekeeping)
- Chunked content delivery
- Natural breaks to prevent overload
- Backfilling foundations before adding complexity

### 4. Zone of Proximal Development

**Research:** Vygotsky (1978)

**Finding:** Optimal learning occurs just beyond current capability, with appropriate scaffolding.

**Applied in skill:**
- Prerequisite probing identifies current level
- Backfill sequence provides scaffolding
- Adaptive difficulty based on demonstrated understanding

### 5. Elaborative Interrogation

**Research:** Dunlosky et al. (2013)

**Finding:** Asking "why" and "how" questions during learning improves comprehension and retention.

**Applied in skill:**
- Probing questions: "What do you know about X?"
- Design questions: "Why would you choose A over B?"
- Explain-back verification

### 6. Interleaving

**Research:** Rohrer & Taylor (2007)

**Finding:** Mixing related topics improves discrimination and transfer.

**Applied in skill:**
- Verification methods vary by content type
- Different question styles keep learner engaged
- Applied exercises connect concepts

### 7. Desirable Difficulties

**Research:** Bjork & Bjork (2011)

**Finding:** Challenges that slow initial learning often enhance long-term retention.

**Applied in skill:**
- Verification requires effort, not just "got it?"
- Struggles trigger deeper teaching, not shortcuts
- Three-attempt rule before pivoting

## Why Just-in-Time Assessment

Traditional approaches assess all prerequisites upfront. Problems:
- Overwhelming at start
- Tests knowledge out of context
- May assess things not actually needed

Just-in-time assessment:
- Tests only what's needed for the next chunk
- Tests in context of where it will be used
- Reveals gaps precisely when they matter
- More motivating (learner sees immediate relevance)

## Why Verification Matters

Without verification, common failure modes:
- Learner nods along without understanding
- Gaps compound over subsequent chunks
- False confidence leads to later confusion

With verification:
- Gaps caught immediately
- Misconceptions corrected in context
- Builds genuine confidence
- Teacher can adapt in real-time
